This is a repository for dumb, stupid experiments where I try to make programs do unhealthy things. I am doing this to improve my own programming knowledge, and because I think it'll be fun. 

DISCLAIMER:
Everything here will be awful. Look/ touch/ steal at risk to your own mental health.

For inquiries, including but not limited to "what is this", "why would you do this" and "who hurt you", I can be reached at:
